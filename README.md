# physio_empatica_watch_viz

This is an RShiny app for visualizing EDA and BVP/PPG signals collected from the Empatica EmbracePlus watch. It allows users to explore signal segments based on key study event markers: the start of baseline, start and end of the first ride, and start and end of the second ride. You can adjust the signal viewing window and scroll through the timeline to examine the data more closely.

To use the app, upload zipped files from both the Empatica EmbracePlus watch (containing .avro files) and the Biopac ring (used for event markers).

## Future Plans
	â€¢	Integrate event markers directly from the watch (not currently used in this study).
	â€¢	Enable manual event marker selection in the app UI.
	â€¢	Add plotting functionality based on user-defined markers.
